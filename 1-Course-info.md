    <h5>Prerequisites</h5> 
Ideally, you have to taken C121 and CS122. If not, you might get away it, but if you have not mastered C++ programming language, recursion, expect to have a very hard time in this class. If you have taken a data structures course before, you might be able to skip this course.

    There will be two types of project. You can do the first type individually, adn the last as part of a group of two or three students. The Students in group do not work alone on the last type of project.

    <h5>Cheating</h5> 
1. Never have a copy of someone else's program in your possession and never give your program to someone else.
<br>
2. Discussing an assignment without sharing any code is generally okay. Helping someone to fix errors/ bugs is an example of permissible collaboration. However, if you get a significat idea from someone, acknowledge them in your assignment.
<br>
3. These rules apply to homeworks and projects. No discussiong whatsoever in exams, of course.
<br>
4. In group projects, you work together through github only that I will be created during the study period.
